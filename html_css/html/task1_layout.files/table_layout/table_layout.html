                    <h2> A text about dogs </h2><br/>
<p>
 THE popularity of the dog as a companion, as a 
guardian of property, as an assistant in the pursuit of 
game, and as the object of a pleasurable hobby, has 
never been so great as it is at the present time. More 
dogs are kept in this country than ever there formerly 
were, and they are more skilfully bred, more tenderly 
treated, and cared for with a more solicitous pride than 
was the case a generation ago. There are fewer mongrels 
in our midst, and the family dog has become a respect- 
able member of society. Two million dog licences were 
taken out in the British Isles in the course of 1909. In 
that year, too, as many as 906 separate dog shows were 
sanctioned by the Kennel Club and held in various parts 
of the United Kingdom. At the present time there exist 
no fewer than 156 specialist clubs established for the 
purpose of watching over the interests of the different 
breeds.

Recognising this advance in our national love of dogs 
and the growing demand for information on their distin- 
guishing characteristics, I am persuaded that there is 
ample room for a concise and practical handbook on 
matters canine. In preparing the present volume, I have 
drawn abundantly upon the contents of my larger and 
more expensive New Book of The Dog, and I desire to 
acknowledge my obligations to the eminent experts who 
assisted me in the production of the earlier work and 
whose contributions I have further utilised in these pages. 
I am indebted to Mr. W. J. Stubbs for his clear exposition 
of the points of the Bulldog, to Colonel Claude Cane for<br/><br/>
